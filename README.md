I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in Bonn under the supervision of Markus Hausmann.

My research interests include equivariant chromatic homotopy theory, geometric structures on condensed anima (joint with Nima Rasekh) and higher category theory.  

My non-research interests include Asian cultures!
